# UCSD Midterm Election Maps

Map presenting the 2018 midterm election results for UCSD campus precincts. 
Maps utilize precinct level results released by the [San Diego Registrar of Voters](http://www.livevoterturnout.com/SanDiego/LiveResults/en/Index_5.html).
The results data is filtered and cleaned in the jupyter notebook. The map is made using the Mapbox GL JS library.
